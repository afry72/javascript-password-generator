### JAVASCRIPT PASSWORD GENERATOR

This password generator has been an amazing project for me and i cant wait to put this to good use. This password generator will randomly generate an array of letters, numbers, and symbols at any length between 8 and 128. these passwords are extremely secure and you will mathematically never get the same array twice.

## CHALLENGES

This challenge proved to be extremely difficult. trying to figure out if i should use strings or arrays and trying to decide how i should best randomize the results. pure randomness has always been a problem in computer science but i figured using individual for loops for each character type made it just random enough without introducing a mountain of code.
## USES

this is extremely useful for someone who uses different passwords for every single thing or someone who rotates passwords on a regular basis without any bias
